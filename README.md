### paste-reader

A kinda rubbish solution to reading pastebin on the go

Currently only supports 1 css layout, I can't be bothered adding dependancies to allow more options

Want to read some pastebin raws? Why strain your eyes with black on white?

Default css replace the boring old pastebin palate with a lovely #d4d4d4 on #191919, nice and low contrast while easy to read

NOTE: also it doesn't like indentation
